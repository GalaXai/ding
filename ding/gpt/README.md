# GPT
Developed by OpenAI the decoder of transformer, as described in the [Transformer paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762).

## Dataset
The dataset used for training GPT can be found [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/karpathy/char-rnn/master/data/tinyshakespeare/input.txt).

## Training
